<h1>Utopian Tree</h1>
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.
Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after n growth cycles?
For example, if the number of growth cycles is n=5, the calculations are as follows:<br>

Period  Height<br>
0          1<br>
1          2<br>
2          3<br>
3          6<br>
4          7<br>
5          14

<h2>Input Format</h2>
The first line contains an integer, t, the number of test cases.<br>
t subsequent lines each contain an integer, n, denoting the number of cycles for that test case.

<h2>Output Format</h2>
For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after n cycles. Each height must be printed on a new line.
